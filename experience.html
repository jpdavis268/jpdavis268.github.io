            <p><u>Description:</u> 
                I work mainly as a cashier, running a checkout aisle and helping customers bag groceries. I have received compliments from both customers and
                managers for providing quick and high quality service.

            <h2>McDonald's (West Jefferson, NC) (April 2022 - July 2024)</h2>
            <p><u>Description:</u> 
                During my time here, I mostly worked as a janitor out in the lobby. My responsibilities included keeping the trash under control, cleaning the eating areas and bathrooms, 
                and generally ensuring the areas visible to customers were presentable. I was known for being detail-oriented and organized, and making sure my job was done properly.
                On multiple occasions, a customer came up to me and told me that the dining area was the cleanest they had ever been in.
